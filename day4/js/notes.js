/*Conditions
-Conditional statements are used for make decisions based on different conditions.
 if
 if else
 if else if else
 switch
 ternary operator

if:
-used check if a condition is true and to execute the block code.
-condition inside a parenthesis and block of code inside a curly bracket ({}).

-if isRaining is false the if block will not be executed and we do not see any output.
-in order to see the result of a falsy condition, we should have another block, which is going to be else.

if else:
-if condition is true the first block will be executed, if not the else condition will be executed.

if else if else:
-programming is also full of conditions. we use else if when we have multiple conditions.

switch:
-switch is an alternative of if, if else, if else if else
-Case block runs if the value in the switch statement parenthesis matches with the case value.
-The break statement is to terminate execution so the code execution does not go down after the condition is satisfied.
-The default block runs if all the cases don't satisfy the condition.

ternary operators:
-we've mention it on previous day.
