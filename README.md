# myJsLearningProcess
Hi everyone! I've been working on front-end for 4 months and thinking to upload my notes on my own Github account.
It's my first repository I shared as public here. 
Everyone who wants to get help in some points on JS can take look at my works. Hope these can help you.

Let's go beginners!
