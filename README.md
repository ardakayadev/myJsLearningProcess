# myJsLearningProcess
Hi everyone! I've been working on front-end for 4 months and thinking to upload my notes on my own Github account.

It's my first repository I shared as public here. 

Everyone who wants to get help in some points on JS can take look at my works. Hope these can help you.

I'm writing a documentation on note.js file and apply what I've just learned in the other .js file, for your information.

Let's go beginners!
